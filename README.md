# IGViralBot

## About The Project

<b> How It Works: </b>
* Input Instagram usernames that post similar content to yours in the text box.🔍
* The bot will fetch the most recent 10 posts of all inputted users and with them: 👾
  * Assign a viral score to each post based on attributes like # of likes received, views, and date posted.
  * The viral score is calculated relative to the average number of likes that account receives.
 * At the end the top posts will be displayed along with the corresponding viral scores. 📈 

<b> Who should use this? </b>
* This program is especially useful for people running large networks of instagram accounts. It allows you to easily sift through accounts that would take a long time manually. 😄
